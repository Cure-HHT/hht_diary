/// Abstract persistence contract for the mobile event-sourcing pipeline.
///
/// Two concrete implementations are intended:
///
/// - `SembastBackend` — mobile device (delivered in this package).
/// - `PostgresBackend` — server-side reuse (future phase).
///
/// The contract is deliberately Dart-pure: no Sembast or postgres types leak
/// into the interface, so either backend can be swapped in without changing
/// callers. Writes are grouped into [transaction] bodies to guarantee
/// atomicity across the four logical stores (event log, diary_entries view,
/// per-destination FIFOs, backend_state KV).
// Implements: REQ-d00117-A — transaction atomicity.
// Implements: REQ-d00117-C — appendEvent co-atomic with sequence counter.
// Implements: REQ-d00117-D — upsertEntry whole-row replace.
// Implements: REQ-d00117-E — enqueueFifo initial state.
// Implements: REQ-d00117-F — backend_state KV store for schema_version and
// sequence counter (not 'metadata').

  /// SHALL then persist the event without further advancing the counter.

  /// entirely and rely on [appendEvent] to advance and stamp the counter as
