# Notes:
# 1. Dependabot does NOT support SHA-pinning GitHub Actions
#    - For FDA compliance, consider Renovate (see Linear ticket CUR-XXX)
# 2. Docker base images and tool versions are pinned in versions.env
#    - Updated manually during quarterly maintenance reviews for FDA compliance
# 3. Security updates are enabled automatically if vulnerability alerts are on
# 4. Align this with quarterly maintenance-check.yml reviews
